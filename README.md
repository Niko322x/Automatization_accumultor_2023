- The project involves the robotization of the production of traction battery modules.
- For this purpose, a production line will be designed, which will consist of
of ready-made as well as proprietary solutions.
- The production line will be equipped with special sensors that will
make it possible to control, welding points and the arrangement of battery cells
battery cells.
- A vision system equipped with a deep learning system will be used to check the correctness of welding points
vision system equipped with a deep learning system.
- An actuator tool will be mounted in the welding robot's wrist,
equipped with electrodes for spot welding by means of an electric arc
electric arc.
- At the beginning of the production line will be located a robot whose
destined to pick up cells from the warehouse and place them in the
appropriate position for welding.
